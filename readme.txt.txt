== Description ==

Webmasters can use this tool to prevent their site from appearing in the backlink statistics of another webpage and server logs of referred pages as referrer. The operators of the referred pages cannot see where their visitors come from any more. Untrace.me provides a slick, quality derefering service for free. No ads, interstitials or popups. We promise. 

When using Untrace.me you don't link directly to the external target web page but to Untrace.me which redirects your users to the desired page then. So the target page doesn't get to know that the user actually came from your site.

UntraceMe removes the referer (referrer) from all external links on your blog. It does this by converting all outgoing links on your blog using the untrace.me service and effectively hides your site as origin of the referred link. This option can be activated in the UntraceMe Settings page.
== Installation ==

1. Upload the complete folder `untraceme-dereferer-dereferrer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Go to 'settings' -> 'UntraceMe Settings' and choose preferred settings.

4. Update your post or page to generate the Untrace.me links.
